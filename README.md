I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science program at the University of Memphis. I work at the CUBES Lab advised by Dr. Brandon Booth.

Here are a few things about me:
- 👩🏻‍🔬 My research interests are in Human Centered Computing and multimodal ML/AI. 
- 👯 Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer, QA for over three and a half years in Bangladesh.
- 🤔 I moved to the States in the Fall of 2022 and have learned intensively about vision and imaging through courses like Fourier transformations, Image Processing and Computer Vision during my time in RIT and have garnered various interdisciplinary skills.
- I have always wanted to be a computer scientist and after brutally struggling for one year at RIT, I had to quit Imaging Science and returned to Computer Science.
- 📫 If you want to reach me, email me at israt.n@memphis.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: She, Her 
- ⚡ I love table tennis and travelling a lot, and right now I am trying to learn bouldering (but I suck at it).
