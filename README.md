I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science program at the University of Memphis. I work at the CUBES Lab advised by Dr. Brandon Booth.

Here are a few things about me:
- 👩🏻‍🔬 My research interests are in Multimodal AI and Learning, Machine Learning , Perceptional Modelling, and Affective Computing. 
- 👯 Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer, QA for over three and a half years in Bangladesh at Therap BD LTD. It was a very memorable experience I had the most amazing colleagues.
- 🤔 I moved to the States in the Fall of 2022 and started my PhD in Imaging Science at RIT. In that one year, I learned about imaging through courses like Fourier transformations, Radiometry, Optics, Image Processing and Computer Vision.  
- 🏫 I have always wanted to be a computer scientist and after brutally struggling for one year academically at RIT, I had to quit Imaging Science. Fortunately, my return to Computer Science has been one of the most fulfilling things that has happened to me in a very long time.

- ⚡ I enjoy sports and strength training a lot. When not in the lab you can find me at the table tennis court or floating in the pool. :D
